			<p class="intro">One of the biggest challenges international students face in New York City is finding housing while they are adjusting to moving into a new country. Part of the higher education institutions do not provide dorms or off-campus housing solutions for their students, which forces internatoinals to navigate an unfamiliar situation on their own, without help or support. According to <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/content/tenantprotection/pages/fast-facts-about-housing-in-nyc">NYC official data</a> as of 2017 “citywide rental vacancy rate is 3.63%, below the 5% threshold required for rent regulation to continue under State law. This translates into the availability of just 79,190 vacant units out of almost 2.2 million rental units citywide”, which creates an extremely high level of competition on apartments in New York City.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the demand on apartments is high, many of the landlords and building management companies comfortably tend to prefer leasing their properties to citizens of USA or non-citizens who have a sufficient and stable income and credit score, rather than leasing to international students who usually have limited to no income, regardless of whether they have decent savings, grants or other means to pay the rent. In many cases, that leaves students with little options of apartments with less competition, which can be distant from school, in unsafe areas or of extremely poor living standards.

					<h4>Proof of income</h4>

					<figcaption class="graphic-text">According to <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment">official government student visa rules</a>, international students do not have work authorization for off-campus jobs. In some cases, they may work for a maximum of 20 hours per week on-campus and with permission only, the requirement of income for rent needs to be 40-50 times the rent to qualify, which is why most international students can’t meet this requirement.

					<figcaption class="graphic-text">According to <a href="https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/work/obtaining-a-social-security-number">Department of Homeland Security</a>, a work-authorization is required in order to obtain a social security number, which means that internationals students are unable to obtain a social security number unless they receive work-authorization. An international student who recently moved to New York City would not have credit score or tax files either, as they would need to be working, have a USA bank account, credit card and build credit score gradually for several months. </figcaption>

					<h4>Guarantor requirements</h4>
					<img src="images/icon 3.jpeg">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Renters who do not have an income are required to have a guarantor who signs the lease. The guarantor is required to have an income of at least 80 times the rent. Many new international students in New York City don’t have family or friends who can be their guarantor, which is why they may refer to guarantor websites that provide this service. However, many students can’t afford this service as it can be expensive. And in many cases, the landlords or building management agencies do not accept website guarantors.</figcaption>
